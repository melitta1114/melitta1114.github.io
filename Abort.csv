"Zambia,5,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,""An abortion requires the consent of three physicians, one of whom must be a specialist in the branch of medicine related to the woman’s reason for seeking an abortion. However, the requirement may be waived if the abortion is immediately necessary to save the life or prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the woman. A legal abortion must be performed by a registered physician in a government hospital or other approved institution unless the patient’s life is in danger."",,UN and WHO,https://esa.un.org/gapp/about_database.aspx";;
"Zimbabwe,4,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,""A legal abortion must be performed by a physician in a designated institution with the permission of the superintendent of the institution . If the pregnancy resulted from unlawful intercourse, a magistrate of a court in the jurisdiction where the abortion will be performed must certify that the alleged intercourse was reported to the police and that pregnancy may have resulted from it. When the abortion is requested because the pregnancy poses a threat to the life or physical health of the pregnant woman, or on grounds of foetal impairment, two physicians that are not members of the same practice must certify to the relevant hospital superintendent that one of these conditions exists. However, if the woman’s life is in danger, a physician can perform the abortion in a place other than a designated institution and without a second medical opinion."",,UN and WHO,https://esa.un.org/gapp/about_database.aspx";;
